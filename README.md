# Nexus Smart AI Team

Nexus is a smart computer system where a team of AI helpers works together to solve hard problems automatically. It uses advanced AI to think, plan, and learn from the past.

## 🚀 Why This App is Special
*   **AI Teamwork:** 6 specialized AI helpers (Leader, Planner, Thinker, Worker, Storage, and Checker) talk to each other to reach a goal.
*   **Past Learning:** The AI looks at "Smart Notes" from past successes to find the best way to act.
*   **Live Map:** A moving map shows you exactly how the AI agents are talking and sharing ideas.
*   **Auto-Fixing:** If something goes wrong, the AI realizes the mistake and tries a new plan.
*   **Smart Storage:** It uses three types of memory: Fast (Now), Smart (Search), and Past (History).
*   **Full Documentation:** See [CORE_CONCEPTS.md](./CORE_CONCEPTS.md) for a full list of system concepts.
